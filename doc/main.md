Grin
----

Grin uses a poor heuristic to determine if you're on an amazon store page that is smile eligible.

Roadmap
-------

1. Improve detection of smile eligible pages by making a head request before redirecting
2. Improve heuristics to prevent multiple requests for the same page. Maybe a cache with the last 10 urls or something.
